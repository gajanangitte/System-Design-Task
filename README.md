## Getting Started

This a system design project for a Travel Management Agency (Yatra).

To Run JUnit tests, browse ./src/tests/

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

- `src/app`: the folder to maintain system files
- `src/tests`: the folder to maintain JUnit tests
- `uml/` : the folder to maintain UML diagrams for app as well as test files 


> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
